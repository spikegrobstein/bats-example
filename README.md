# BATS example

This is a super-contrived example for writing tests using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) to
illustrate how to test library code and commandline executable code.

It demonstrates the following techniques:

 * testing status codes
 * testing contents of output
 * testing number of lines of output
 * testing for no output
 * stubbing external executables
 * overriding environment variables
 * using test helpers

Hopefully this will be of some help to someone, somewhere.
